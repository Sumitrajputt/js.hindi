Operator in javascript.

operator in javascript is a special symbol or keyword that is used to perform operations on operands (values and variables). Operators can be classified into several categories based on their functionality. Here are some common types of operators in JavaScript:
// Arithmetic Operators: Used for mathematical calculations.


let a = 10;
let b = 5;
let sum = a + b; // Addition


different types of operators in javascript


assigmentment operator
conditional operator
increment and decrement operator
comparison operator
logical operator    




let difference = a - b; // Subtraction
let product = a * b;    // Multiplication
let quotient = a / b;  // Division
let remainder = a % b; // Modulus           
let increment = ++a; // Increment
let decrement = --b; // Decrement



// Assignment Operators: Used to assign values to variables.


let a=10;
let b=5;
console.log(a + b); // a = a + b

modulus operator in java script



assigment operator in javascript
let x = 10; // Assignment
x += 5; // x = x + 5
x -= 3; // x = x - 3
x *= 2;


comparisiopn operator in javascript


let x = 10; 
let y = 5;
console.log(x > y); // Greater than
console.log(x < y); // Less than
console.log(x >= y); // Greater than or equal to
console.log(x <= y);            // Less than or equal to

console.log(x == y); // Equal to
console.log(x != y); // Not equal to
console.log(x === y); // Strict equal to
console.log(x !== y); // Strict not equal to
console.log(x === 10); // Strict equal to
console.log(x !== 5); // Strict not equal to
console.log(x == '10'); // Equal to
console.log(x != '5'); // Not equal to
console.log(x === '10'); // Strict equal to



Logical Operators: Used to combine multiple conditions.


let x = 10;
let y = 5;
console.log(x > 5 && y < 10); // Logical AND
console.log(x > 15 || y < 10); // Logical OR
console.log(!(x > 5)); // Logical NOT
